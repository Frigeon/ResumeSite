						Having made the decision to go back to school in September of 2010 I started looking into different<br />programs and schools to attend for computer science. I also started looking into possible funding to get<br />this education.  As it turned out I was unable to get funding for anything except a 2-year diploma program,<br />and so I stumbled upon the CSOM program. Probably the best thing that could have happened one way<br />or the other.

						Having been given the opportunity to take the Food Safe Course through the Vancouver Island Health<br />Authority by my employer at Petro-Canada for whom I was running the in-store bakery I jumped<br />at the opportunity and have since used this certification in several volunteer positions and while<br />working at Subway in Kamloops.
