					My work with the CWA originated with Nanaimo's TOTGC where I had gotten involved as the<br />Librarian and Membership director. I was voted in as the Communications Director of the CWABC in part<br />because of my work in the CSOM program at Thompson Rivers University. In this role I am presently working on<br />various websites as well as a membership database in MS Access.

					Having done a large amount of research into green housing after having watched the film Garbage Warrior, my parents<br />had decided to purchase a property along Highway 24 in BC and build an Earthship. My wife and I decided at this time<br />to support my parents by moving out to the property with them and assisting during the build. We were actually able to<br />bring the Reynolds Crew out to work on the build with us!

					As the Elected Librarian and Membership Director of the TOTGC I developed a lot of organizational <br />skills and learned how to manage and maintain several different lists at once, including sign-in sheets as well as a small<br />library of reference material.
